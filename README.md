# UFOs

## Background
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. The objective is to have a html page that allows the user to filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria.

## HTML Page:

The welcome page provides an overview of the website. Further down the website, the user has options to filter out the data with five different criterias. Depending on the need, multiple filters can be selected at the same time.
